// Unfortunately Babel caches the compiled version of this file until the file changes.
// transform-inline-environment-variables is supposed to replace the value above for us.
// But we'd like the file to be recompiled when an environment variable changes.

// and can be changed by the startup script.
// This file is included in .gitignore for convenience
