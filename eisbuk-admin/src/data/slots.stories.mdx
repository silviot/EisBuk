# Slots for bookings

Slots are the basic unit that can be booked.

They have a point in time and some metadata.

This is their primary representation. Clients send this kind of serialisation to the `slots` collection.

```javascript
slots = {
  foo: {
    categories: ["agonismo", "preagonismo", "corso"],
    type: "ice",
    date: { seconds: 1609513200 },
    durations: [60],
  },
  bar: {
    date: { seconds: 1609495200 },
    categories: ["preagonismo"],
    type: "off-ice-danza",
    durations: [90, 120],
  },
  baz: {
    date: { seconds: 1609516800 },
    categories: ["agonismo"],
    type: "off-ice-gym",
    durations: [60, 90, 120],
  },
};
```

Their ids in the database MUST be uuid4 to avoid collisions. In these examples they are readable strings for clarity.

When a slot is saved a server function is triggered that mirrors the slot contents in a `slotsByDay` collection.

`slotsByDay` is organized like this:

```javascript
slotsByDay = {
  "2021-01": {
    "2021-01-15": {
      ...slots,
    },
    "2021-01-16": {}, // There can be empty days
  },
};
```

# Booking records

When user want to book a slot they create an entry in `bookings/secret_key`.

The secret key is automatically generated and stored alongside the user data.

Users access the booking page using a URL that includes the secret key.

When a booking is added a triggger updates an aggregation of bookings collection.

The `bookingsByDay` collection is organized like this:

```javascript
bookingsByDay = {
  "2021-01": {
    slot0Id: {
      customer1Id: 60,
    },
    slot1Id: {
      customer1Id: 60,
      customer2Id: 90,
      customer3Id: 60,
    },
    slot2Id: {
      customer1Id: 120,
      customer3Id: 90,
      customer6Id: 120,
    },
  },
};
```
